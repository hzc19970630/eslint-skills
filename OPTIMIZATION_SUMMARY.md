## 📚 Documentation Still Needed

Consider adding (not urgent):

- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - How to contribute
  - See template in `GITHUB_OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md`

- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Community standards
  - Use: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/

- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history
  - Start tracking when you release v1.1

- **Chinese README** - You have "中文文档" link but no file
  - Copy README.md → README.zh-CN.md
  - Translate key sections

**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Priority:** Low (can wait until you get feedback)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / To Fix

1. **README line 14**: "English" and "中文文档" links point to `#`
   - Need to create actual pages or remove

2. **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Referenced in several places but doesn't exist
   - Create from template

3. **Demo GIF**: Placeholder, needs actual recording
   - Follow guide when ready

4. **Social Preview**: Not uploaded yet
   - Do after first launch
